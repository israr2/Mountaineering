            Whether looking to climb mountains in this country or overseas, your body is sure to face some key fitness battles so you need to be properly prepared for what you might face, including potential emergencies.Training for mountaineering: Mountaineering is a pursuit that should never be undertaken without a good understanding of the many different aspects involved, ranging from map reading and navigation skills to rope work and understanding mountain weather. You should definitely consider booking up with a reputable organisation offering expert advice.

                <span class="first">Preparation and planning:</span>
                Take time to plan and prepare for your ascent. This will be time well spent and the chances of your having a successful and enjoyable ascent will be far higher if you have prepared well. Take time to plan your route and prepare your kit regardless of whether you’re going for a short climb or a two month expedition, some careful planning can make all the difference. As well as careful planning, always check your kit before you leave … it is no good being out on the mountain only to find you left your ice-ax at home.

                <span class="first">Footwear for mountaineering:</span>
                Make sure you invest in a good pair of rugged mountaineering boots. For summer mountaineering you can get away with a stiff pair of walking boots, but for winter mountaineering a crampon rated boot will be needed. Visit a reputable outdoor retailer who will offer good advice on the best mountaineering boot to suit your needs.

                <span class="first">Food for mountaineering: </span>
                Make sure to carry plenty of food (and water) on any mountaineering trip. Food needs to be high in energy and lightweight. Many high-energy bars and pre-packaged meals are now available. Food can make or break longer expeditions so make sure the food you carry is something tasty and enjoyable too! It is essential on any mountaineering trip to carry emergency rations in case you are on the mountain for longer than anticipated.

                <span class="first">Weather watching:</span>
                Before embarking on any mountaineering trip make sure you get a local weather forecast. You can always postpone a summit attempt for another day, with more favourable weather conditions. However, once you are on a mountaineering route you will often be committed with little options for retreat so checking the weather in advance is a must!

                Too many completely avoidable accidents and injuries occur in mountaineering because people simply underestimate the awesome forces of mountain weather. Always carry an emergency shelter, they are small and lightweight but can be life savers, protecting you from the elements should the weather suddenly turn. There are many shelters available from two-person to large group shelters. Some of the best available are Terra Novas Bothy Bags.

Islamabad : Speaking at a webinar on ‘mountaineering challenges confronting Pakistan,’ the experts urged the government to urgently establish a professional mountaineering school and a strong Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) having right professionals on board.

The experts also appreciated the Pakistan army for conducting the rescue operations quite efficiently when needed. They highlighted that getting a mountaineering permit takes too long despite the Prime Minister’s instruction to reduce the processing time. It takes too much time to get a visa for the foreign tourists though the federal government has announced a lenient visa policy. The webinar was organised by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on Saturday. The panel of experts included well-known mountaineer Nazir Sabir, another well-known mountaineer Col (r) Abdul Jabbar Bhatti, founder and chairman Baltistan Association of Tour Operators (BATO) Muhammad Iqbal, Secretary Alpine Club of Pakistan Karrar Haideri, mountaineering trainer Dr. Shabbir Naqvi, president Adventure Club Tahir Imran Khan, Pakistan Mountain Festival founder and director and Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed, event manager Samreen Akhtar, and Ozyegin University student of Hospitality and Tourism Management Shaaref Munir. Nazir Sabir said all stakeholders need to sit together to develop an integrated policy for mountaineering and trekking. Mountaineering should be a national phenomenon like cricket. But unfortunately we lack state patronage and recognition and so is the case of corporate sponsorships.

In fact, the Alpine Club Pakistan has no capacity to handle the national framework of mountaineering and it needs to be reformed. Col (r) Abdul Jabbar Bhatti said mountaineering is an adventure sport that is based on your own resources, skills and risk. Mountaineers and High Altitude Porters (HAPs) have no insurance schemes in Pakistan, no proper training and no sponsorships. Corporate sector will not come up to support this sport until it is not adequately mainstreamed. We have no structured system for mountaineering and trekking. We need to put ‘right persons on the right jobs’ if interested to do the needful, and it will not happen sooner even if we start today. Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said rights professionals and a vigorous framework is very essential for mainstreaming of mountaineering. Government and the state institutions need to have some liberal and lenient policies to attract foreign mountaineers and trekkers. We shall also have an adequate monitoring and checking system to reduce high altitude pollution.

Secretary ACP Karrar Haideri said the Alpine Club received a lot of criticism but not funding at least for the last three years even though we are trying to survive. All officer bearers perform their duties without any remunerations. We have taken up issues with the government several times but are still waiting for the patronage and support. The Pakistan army has had a meeting of stakeholders recently to develop an outline of the framework to promote mountaineering in Pakistan. The National Tourism Coordination Board (NTCB) is also focusing on it.

Dr. Shabbir Naqvi said we lack funding and training for mountaineering in general because the ACP could not deliver the desired outcome as envisaged in their mandate. We have yet to organize and recognize mountaineering as a sport. Nepal offers Bachelor and Masters level education in mountaineering while we have no professional training school. Tahir Imran Khan said we need to have professionalism to attract commercialism along with a thorough professional attitude of the relevant organizations. Marketing of the mountains is very important that is not possible without collaboration of all stakeholders.                </p>

                    Tak It Hame is a Mountaineering Scotland campaign that says what it means: encouraging the mountaineering community, and others, to remove litter and plastic from our hills and crags.

                    Tak It Hame aims to make a difference.
                    
                     We encourage everyone taking to the hills and climbing the crags to do a little on every trip, individually, or as part of a group or club outing.  And to show others too: tell the world that we can all do something.  Many of us already do, but the litter still accumulates. We need more people to do the same.  The message is: can you bring back more than you took out?

                    We get approached every week by government agencies, local authorities, national parks and developers to comment on proposed wind farms designed to generate more than 50MW. Our decision to respond or object is guided by specific criteria, reflecting our vision, Respecting Scotland's Mountains. We only object to a very small proportion, but if permitted, they could have a huge impact on the wildness of some cherished locations.
