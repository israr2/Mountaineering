            Mountaineers face a variety of hazards. When climbing mountains, there are two types of hazards, objective and subjective. Objective hazards relate to the environment, and may include inclement weather conditions, dangerous terrain, and poor equipment. Subjective hazards relate to a climber's poor judgement, poor planning, lack of skills, or inadequate conditioning.

In terms of objective hazards, the dangers mountaineers face include falling rocks, falling ice, snow-avalanches, the climber falling, falls from ice slopes, falls down snow slopes, falls into crevasses, and the dangers from altitude and weather
Mountain Climbing Risks: 20 Hazards to Be Aware Of
Written by Marcus  in Uncategorized

Mountain climbing is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers before you go out.

So, what are the main risks in mountain climbing? Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the elements, and altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you’ll face while mountaineering, although that’s far from a comprehensive list.

There’s a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you’ll have to face if you decide to take up this sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you’ll have to content with every time you go mountain climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become relevant once you start pushing the boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade you from mountain climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you can plan for them!

                <span class="first">Falling and Avalanches</span>
                <br>
                Maybe the most common danger, and one that almost everyone is afraid of.
                <br>
                Avalanches can hit you at any time, and even the best mountaineers in the world sometimes succumb to them.

                <br>
                Weather patterns in the mountains change quickly, and you can find yourself stuck if the conditions suddenly turn.Spending tens of hours in the beating sun or freezing cold can start to mess with your body and brain (I recently dropped a rappel device due to heat stroke).

                Spending too long in the cold will cause your body to start to shut down.
                Not getting enough oxygen to your brain can muddle your thinking and cause fever-like symptoms

                <br>
                Rapid ascent can lead to altitude sickness. The best treatment is to descend immediately. The climber's motto at high altitude is "climb high, sleep low", referring to the regimen of climbing higher to acclimatise but returning to lower elevation to sleep. In the Andes, the chewing of coca leaves has been traditionally used to treat altitude sickness symptoms.
Common symptoms of altitude sickness include severe headache, sleep problems, nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy and body ache. Mountain sickness may progress to HACE (High altitude cerebral edema) and HAPE (High altitude pulmonary edema), both of which can be fatal within 24 hours.
In high mountains, atmospheric pressure is lower and this means that less oxygen is available to breathe.[35] This is the underlying cause of altitude sickness. Everyone needs to acclimatise, even exceptional mountaineers that have been to high altitude before. Generally speaking, mountaineers start using bottled oxygen when they climb above 7,000 m. Exceptional mountaineers have climbed 8000-metre peaks (including Everest) without oxygen, almost always with a carefully planned program of acclimatisation.

                When climbing in a hot environment, you risk getting heat injuries. This includes heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

When climbing in a cold environment, you could lose your body heat too quickly. This leads to frostbites and hypothermia.

Heat exhaustion:

This is due to your body overheating.
Symptoms include heavy sweating, dizziness, fainting, quick and weak heartbeat, headache, nausea, fatigue.
What to do:
Rest in the shade, drink cold water or sports drink.
Seek medical attention if the condition does not improve.
Heat stroke:

When heat exhaustion is not treated, you could get heat stroke.
Symptoms include fever (temperature going above 104 F (40 C)), dry skin,  dizziness, pounding heartbeat, headache, nausea, fatigue, confusion, loss of consciousness.
What to do:
Rest in the shade, drink cold water or sports drink.
Remove all excess clothing, use water/ sponges/ ice packs/ wet towels to cool the body.
Seek medical attention immediately.
Hypothermia:

This is due to the loss of body heat.
Symptoms include temperatures going below 95 F (35 C), shivering, slow and shallow breathing, weak heartbeat, fatigue, confusion, loss of consciousness.
What to do:
Move to a dry and warm location, remove any wet or cold clothing, cover with warm and dry clothing and blankets.
Drink hot or warm drinks.
Seek medical attention.
Frostbite:

Extreme loss of body heat which causes freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. This usually occurs at your extremities such as hands and feet
Symptoms include cold skin, prickly feeling, numbness, the stiffness of joints and muscles, skin turning red, white or blueish.
What to do:
Move to a dry and warm location, remove any wet or cold clothing, cover with warm and dry clothing and blankets.
Stop walking if your feet are frostbitten,
You can use heating packs to warm your hands and feet. But do this slowly to avoid burns.
Drink hot or warm drinks.
Seek medical attention immediately.
How to avoid getting too hot:

Protect yourself from the sun with caps and long sleeve shirts and pants.
Take frequent breaks in the shade.
Hydrate regularly. Don’t avoid drinking water because you want to avoid having to pee.
Avoid wearing too many layers of clothing. You will dehydrate more quickly from sweating.
If you are feeling unwell, inform someone and stop climbing.
How to avoid getting too cold:

Pack appropriate climbing attire. Bring along a few thinner layers instead of one thick jacket.
Pack portable heat source such as heat packs.
Make sure to stay dry.
Have proper wet weather protection such as waterproof jackets or ponchos.
Avoid walking through water bodies such as rivers and streams.
Avoid wearing too many layers of clothing. The evaporation of sweat will cause you to lose body heat.

                <br>
                You are disturbing the wildlife’s habitat in an area where human activity is low.
If you did not store your food or dispose of your waste properly, they can attract wildlife.
You are wearing strongly scented products. Some strong odors might attract wildlife.
What happens when you encounter wildlife:

You might get attacked by provoked or scared animals.
You might get bitten or stung by poisonous snakes, spiders, and other insects.
Wildlife might take your food or damage your stuff.
How to avoid encountering wildlife:

Make loud noises (in a considerate manner, not by blasting loud music). A bear bell is a common accessory for people climbing in areas with a bear population. Walking loudly will also keep a lot of animals and snakes away.
Store your food properly. Use ziplocks or airtight containers to keep the smell in.
Store your trash properly. Leaving food waste around is like leaving breadcrumbs for the animals.
Use bug sprays.
Avoid wearing bright, floral colored clothing which may attract bees and wasps.
What to do if you encounter wildlife:

Don’t approach them. Don’t scare them. Back away slowly and quietly.
Don’t feed any wildlife. Not even the friendly, harmless looking ones like deer or squirrels. Once they are used to being fed by humans, they will start approaching all human for food. And they won’t take no for an answer!
If you think you are in danger, flee where possible, preferably to higher grounds. If you don’t think you can outrun them, you should make loud noises. You can also make yourself appear bigger by standing tall and grabbing large sticks or rocks. Hire a guide. New climbers should always hire a guide. Even experienced climbers should hire a guide when going on more challenging climbs.
